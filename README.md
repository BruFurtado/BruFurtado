<p style="text-align:center">I'm 21 years old, I'm from Minas Gerais and I'm passionate about codes!</p>

I am currently learning on Web and Mobile Development. I really like this area a lot! I'm studying the Rocketseat LaunchBase bootcamp and right after finishing it, I'm going to start the BootStamp GoStack. I aim to become a FullStack developer. My current skills are: HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node.js. As a Database, I am using PostgreSQL and MySQL.

I’m looking to collaborate on two projects that aim to generate content for students. One of them is SEEAC, Seminar on Electrical Engineering, Control and Automation and Computing, I have been participating in SEEAC since last year, and this year, I was in coordination as vice president. Given the situation we are currently experiencing, we adapted the event to the online format, with a week of lectures, courses and mentoring. In addition, I am in a project that is being born now, with the objective of increasing contact between students of Computer Engineering and professionals in the job market in the area of Software development.
